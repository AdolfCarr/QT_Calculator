# Math Basic Calculator

## Project Description

The Math Basic Calculator is a simple and user-friendly application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. 
The calculator supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
This project serves as a foundational tool for understanding and implementing GUI applications using Qt and C++.

## Features

- **Addition**: Perform addition of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Perform subtraction of one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- **Division**: Perform division of one number by another.
- **Clear Functionality**: Clear the input and output fields for new calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface for users of all ages.

## Technologies Used

- **Qt**: A powerful cross-platform application framework used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of 
the calculator.
- **C++**: The programming language used for implementing the core logic and functionality of the calculator.

## How to run the project
- **Open Qt Creator**: Launch Qt Creator on your computer.

- **Open Project**: Navigate to File -> Open File or Project... in the menu bar.

- **Select Project Directory:** In the dialog box, navigate to the directory containing your CMakeLists.txt file.

  - Select the folder that represents your project (it should contain your CMakeLists.txt file).
  - Click Open to load the project into Qt Creator.
- **Configure the Project**: Qt Creator will automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file and configure the project. It may prompt 
you to select a build directory if it's the first time opening the project.

- **Build the Project**: After the project is loaded, you will see it in the Projects pane on the left side of Qt Creator.

  - If necessary, configure your build settings (like selecting a build kit or target).
  - Click on the hammer icon (Build Project) in the bottom left corner to build the project. This step compiles your code.

- **Run the Project**: Once the project is successfully built without errors, click on the green play button (or press Ctrl + R) to run the project.

- **View Output**: Qt Creator will show the application's output in the Application Output pane at the bottom of the screen. This pane displays any console output from your application.
