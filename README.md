- It supports:
 Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 Commun memory operation.

## Solution to the FInd All Hobbies
An implementation of a solution to map hobby categories to individual names using C++ standard library containers (`std::map` and `std::vector`). The solution includes corrections for typos and necessary headers (`#include <algorithm>`) to ensure correct functionality of `std::find`. It demonstrates an alternative approach to iterating through the data using iterators.

### Implementation Details
- [Structured Bindings](https://github.com/AdolfCarr/QT_Calculator/blob/main/findAllHobbits/findAllHobbits_structuredBinding.cpp): Initially considered but not used due to compilation issues caused by the structured binding syntax, which requires C++17 support.
- [Iterators](https://github.com/AdolfCarr/QT_Calculator/blob/main/findAllHobbits/findAllHobbits_iteartor.cpp): Implemented as an alternative approach to iterate through the `HobbiesMap` and access values associated with each key-value pair.
